This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Getting Started with Code
### Node.js

### React-Router-Dom
So we are building a React app with multiple routes and it requires a package react-router-dom. Install it with NPM.

`npm i react-router-dom`

### VS Code

## To Run Local Code

After successfully cloning the code. Open folder in VSCode. Next open a terminal in VS Code. Save your files. 

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm start`
