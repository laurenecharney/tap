# TAP (The Afterschool Program) Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Getting Started
### Node.js
Download Node.js which can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### React-Router-Dom
So we are building a React app with multiple routes and it requires a package react-router-dom. Install it with NPM.

'npm i react-router-dom'

### VS Code
Download VS Code as IDE: https://code.visualstudio.com

## To Run

After successfully cloning the code. Open folder in VSCode. Next open a terminal in VS Code. Save your files. 

### 'npm run build'

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
